# crowd_evacuation
You can see the problem statement and procedure for solution in the code file itself.
How to give inputs:
  1) In the first code cell, there is a function called match_doors. For giving inputs this cell doesn't do anything.
  2) In the second code cell, we have to give inputs. 
  
      a) Edit N and M values
      
      b) Edit people coordinates and exit-doors coordinates at "ppl_coor" and "exits_coor" lists respectively.
      
      c) If there are any blockages, then edit at "blockages" respectively
      
      d) I wrote two cases for input. You have to uncomment one of the case otherwise case-2 will be input always.
  
  3) After giving inputs, run both code cells. You will see the output at the bottom of second-code cell.
     The output describes that which person has to exit through which exit door.
